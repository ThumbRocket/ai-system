BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latent) is a self-supervised learning method, specifically an unsupervised learning technique, that enables effective image representation learning without the need for large pre-trained datasets.

# NPU Practice
#### `./NPU_Design/Amaranth/pakage_ta/inference.py`  
this code instruct ISA using Amaranth. Using model is CNN and QLinear,  QConv2d make amaranth ISA. if you run this code, you check performance between ISA Anaranth and normal model.
